# Hello World: Vivado

## Vivado-Test Project Creation

### Project Creation

Follow the ppt. The process is almost the same. Using **part xc7z020clg484-1**. Nothing special.

When you do Generate Bitstream at the ppt **page 25~28**, the process bar popup will suddenly disappear. But the process is still running in the background. So just wait for a while, until the complete popup is shown.
You can see the process at the **Design Runs** tab at the bottom window.

If you reached at **page 32**, then testing Vivado may be done. Now, it is the time for Vitis.
