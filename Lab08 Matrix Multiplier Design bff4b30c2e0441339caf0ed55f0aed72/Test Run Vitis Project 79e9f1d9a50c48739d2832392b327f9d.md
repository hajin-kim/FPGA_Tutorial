# Test Run: Vitis Project

# Vitis Project

At this part, we should just make Vitis projects and run them. That's all.

We have to care about only 3 parts.

## 1. Project creation

## 2. Makefile problem

After creating the projects, we have to fix some Makefile files. Edit some Makefiles before doing the ppt **page 26**. Refer to [Makefile Problem](https://www.notion.so/Makefile-Problem-b266174a19ec426eba6e8e8b3119c7d0)
