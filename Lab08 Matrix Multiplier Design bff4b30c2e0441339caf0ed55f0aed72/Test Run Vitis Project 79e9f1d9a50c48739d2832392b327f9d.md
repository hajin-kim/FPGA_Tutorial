# Test Run: Vitis Project

# Vitis Project

At this part, we should just make Vitis projects and run them. That's all.

We have to care about only 3 parts.

## 1. Project creation

Refer to [Alternative: Direct Creation of Vitis Application Project from Vivado Hardware](https://github.com/hajin-kim/FPGA_Tutorial_with_HLS/blob/main/Lab05%20Hello%20World%20with%20Vitis%20and%20Vivado%20d3897032db324f5d9531e5ab0a9af6df/Alternative%20Direct%20Creation%20of%20Vitis%20Application%20P%20c3733968f81641d19b17885f5466a621.md) 

## 2. Makefile problem

After creating the projects, we have to fix some Makefile files. Edit some Makefiles before doing the ppt **page 26**. Refer to [Makefile Problem](https://github.com/hajin-kim/FPGA_Tutorial_with_HLS/blob/main/Troubleshootings%20f43673650b7c4eb5b83fa2b7a80452e2/Makefile%20Problem%20b266174a19ec426eba6e8e8b3119c7d0.md) 

## 3. Code import and edit

Ppt **page 26**. Import 3 files as shown.

Ppt **page 27**. Delete helloworld.c file as shown.

Ppt **page 28**. Answer codes are here: [IMPORTANT Changes to the Lab Materials](IMPORTANT%20Changes%20to%20the%20Lab%20Materials%20a28c99d190d6425482cf195a967e08b6.md) 

Ppt **page 29**. We have to follow ppt.
