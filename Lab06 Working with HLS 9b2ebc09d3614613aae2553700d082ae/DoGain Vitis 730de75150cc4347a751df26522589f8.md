## Creating Vitis application project

Ppt **page 49~50**. The Launch SDK is replaced by Tool-Launch Vitis, and there are additional changes. You have to do:

1. Launch Vitis.
2. Create an Platform and Application Project.

We can directly create an application project from the hardware (.xsa) file. See:
 [Alternative: Direct Creation of Vitis Application Project from Vivado Hardware](https://github.com/hajin-kim/FPGA_Tutorial_with_HLS/blob/main/Lab05%20Hello%20World%20with%20Vitis%20and%20Vivado%20d3897032db324f5d9531e5ab0a9af6df/Alternative%20Direct%20Creation%20of%20Vitis%20Application%20P%20c3733968f81641d19b17885f5466a621.md) 

There may be problems related to Makefile. Please refer to [Makefile Problem](https://github.com/hajin-kim/FPGA_Tutorial_with_HLS/blob/main/Troubleshootings%20f43673650b7c4eb5b83fa2b7a80452e2/Makefile%20Problem%20b266174a19ec426eba6e8e8b3119c7d0.md) 

### Setting the source file

Ppt **page 51**. Open ***{$WORKSPACE_DIR}\{$PROJECT_NAME}\src***.

1. Add the given ***main.c*** to the ***src*** folder.
2. Remove ***helloworld.c*** file.

### Setting the run configuration

Ppt **page 52**.

1. Right click on your system project.
2. Run As-Run Configurations. The below window will pop up.
3. Create a new configuration by double clicking **System Project Debug**.
4. Select it.
5. Nothing more to do. Run.
