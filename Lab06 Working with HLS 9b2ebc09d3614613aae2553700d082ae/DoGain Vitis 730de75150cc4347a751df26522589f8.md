## Creating Vitis application project

Ppt **page 49~50**. The Launch SDK is replaced by Tool-Launch Vitis, and there are additional changes. You have to do:

1. Launch Vitis.
2. Create an Platform and Application Project.

We can directly create an application project from the hardware (.xsa) file. See:
 [Alternative: Direct Creation of Vitis Application Project from Vivado Hardware](https://www.notion.so/Alternative-Direct-Creation-of-Vitis-Application-Project-from-Vivado-Hardware-c3733968f81641d19b17885f5466a621) 

There may be problems related to Makefile. Please refer to [Makefile Problem](https://www.notion.so/Makefile-Problem-b266174a19ec426eba6e8e8b3119c7d0) 

### Setting the source file
